2017-01-23,@storywithdata thanks for the shoutout! Yeah, we need to dig deeper, for sure.
2017-01-23,@jcukier yeah, it‚Äôs very research-focused. I did have a section on tools but took it out because it was getting unwieldy.
2017-01-23,@jcukier I try to mostly keep it separate from Tableau stuff
2017-01-23,@jcukier we‚Äôre certainly much closer than in 2007/8, no doubt ;)
2017-01-23,@jcukier a lot does, certainly. But it‚Äôs hard to write about that, because it‚Äôs behind closed doors. And I don‚Äôt write Tableau case studies.
2017-01-23,@jcukier I agree. And it goes to the problem @FILWD and other discussed a while ago, that many of the success stories are hidden.
2017-01-23,@jcukier perhaps I should really finish that posting about D3 that I‚Äôve been putting off for like five years now‚Ä¶
2017-01-24,@wdncnu much better, since the bars in each columns are on the same baseline. You lose the ability to read the total per row, though.

2017-01-31,Bizarro bughavior in R: one table has field percent, the other percentage. Both show when using $percent, but left_join balks with index err
2017-01-31,Hard to discover, because a$percent and B$percent both work, suggesting the columns have the same name when they don‚Äôt.
2017-01-31,And dplyr‚Äôs error message (‚Äúindex out of bounds‚Äù) is also less than helpful.
2017-01-31,@kirel yeah, that link does not work ;p
2017-01-31,@kirel right, I did not know this behavior. Problem is that dplyr isn‚Äôt as accepting of incomplete names, which makes this confusing.
2017-01-31,@kirel problem is, I often copy lines from the console into R files, so shortened names could easily end up in code. Problematic distinction
2017-02-01,Strangely, these comparisons do little for me except for first one. Also the big Snickers bar looks like a baguette‚Ä¶ https://t.co/b6nmqV4npE
2017-02-01,Perhaps color would‚Äôve helped, especially with the gallon Skittles. But the candy counter doesn‚Äôt impress me, have no idea how much that is.
2017-02-01,@theboysmithy @RobinKwong @adamsamson @jgrovum @RobinWigg Yeah, not for time. You want to compare part to whole, parts should make up 100%

2017-01-07,@amuellerml @jakevdp Definitely a fair point, though with log scales the ticks/gridlines do visually reinforce the variable transformation.
2017-01-07,@amuellerml @jakevdp Also, the lack of a zero baseline with log scales argues against using bars; dot plot probably a better choice.
